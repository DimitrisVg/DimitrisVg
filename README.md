- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I am Dimitris Vogias @DimitrisVg
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science and on how we can use it to undestand and give better Geopolitical answers. Data instead of opinions!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SQL and Machine Learning and building on my Visualization, EDA and Data Science knowledge and skills.
